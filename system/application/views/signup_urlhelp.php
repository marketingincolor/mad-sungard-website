<h1 class="orange">Tips For Choosing Your WebNet Address</h1>

<p>For memorability, it's recommended that you best try to match your WebNet address to reflect what you've chosen for your WebNet site's Display Name.</p>

<p>If you are using this WebNet site to promote an individual installer, simply consider using your name. For example, if your name is Jeff Meadows, enter your WebNet address like this:</p>
<img src="<?php echo base_url();?>images/meadows.jpg" border="0">
<p>If you are using this WebNet site to promote a business name, consider just using your business name. For example, if the business' name is Superb Window Tinters, enter your WebNet address like this:</p>
<img src="<?php echo base_url();?>images/superb.jpg" border="0">
<p>The shorter and more memorable your address the better. In the event you enter a name that has already been chosen by someone else, the form will alert you to make another selection.</p>
