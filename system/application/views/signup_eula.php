<h2>SOLAMATRIX&reg; WebNet Site</h2>
<h3>END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA)</h3>

<p>Solamatrix, Inc. (SMX) employs a third-party vendor, Marketing In Color, Inc. (MIC) to produce and maintain all 
LinkBox Promo Sites for Solamatrix Customers.</p>

<p>This is an END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("EULA") between the end user of the Solamatrix WebNet Promo Site Software 
("Customer") and Marketing In Color, Inc. ("MIC").</p>

<span class="mark">1. MIC Services.</span>
<p>MIC will design, develop, and administer one or more web-based messages (collectively the "Announcements") to be 
displayed via a link in emails sent by Customer, as well as by other means. The Announcements will describe Customer's 
services, will enable readers of the Announcement to refer others to Customer, and/or will provide a method by which 
others might contact Customer. Once a customer has submitted required information to create the Announcement, and, 
when applicable, made payment, the Announcement will be made available for Customer's use.</p>

<span class="mark">2. Customer Responsibilities.</span>
<p>So that MIC will be able to provide the MIC Services (listed in the preceding paragraph), Customer agrees as follows:</p>
<p><span class="mark">2.1</span> Customer will provide to MIC certain information concerning Customer's business (the 
"Business Information") for use in the Announcement. Customer also will provide MIC with updated Business Information 
needed to keep the Announcements current. Customer grants MIC a perpetual, royalty-free license to use Business 
Information, Announcements, and Customer's comments to or about MIC in marketing and advertising MIC's services to others. </p>
<p><span class="mark">2.2</span> Customer recognizes that MIC is a communications company and is not familiar with Customer 
or any legal or professional requirements that might govern Customer or Customer's relationships with customers, regulatory 
agencies, or the public. Customer warrants that Customer and MIC have the right to distribute the Announcement, and that 
doing so will not violate any law, regulation, or the rights of any third party.</p>

<span class="mark">3. General Provisions.</span>
<p><span class="mark">3.1</span> This is the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter of this 
Agreement. No oral understandings or agreements exist that conflict with or contradict the terms of this written Agreement. 
Neither party relied upon any prior oral or written statements in entering into this Agreement. So, for example, Customer 
has not relied upon any representations regarding the effectiveness of the Solamatrix WebNet Promo Site, and Customer 
recognizes that MIC has not guaranteed any particular level of response to the Announcements. </p>
<p><span class="mark">3.2</span> This Agreement is governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of 
the State of Florida, exclusive of its choice of law rules. Both parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state 
and federal courts in or for Hillsborough County, Florida, for the adjudication of any disputes arising from or relating to 
this Agreement. Both parties waive any claim that Hillsborough County, Florida, is an inconvenient forum or improper venue 
or that those courts lack personal jurisdiction over either party.</p>
<p><span class="mark">3.3</span> In any action arising from or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled 
to an award of its costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>
<p><span class="mark">3.4</span> If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, such provision shall be 
limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect 
and enforceable.</p>
<p><span class="mark">3.5</span> Any modifications of this Agreement must be in writing and signed by MIC and Customer, except 
that MIC may modify the terms of this Agreement by sending notice to Customer via e-mail (at the most current e-mail address 
for Customer in MIC's records) or by posting notice of such modification on a page of the LinkBox site titled "Legal Notices" 
or "Legal Information." Such modifications will take effect fourteen (14) days after notice is sent or posted (whichever is earlier).</p>
<p><span class="mark">3.6</span> Customer will indemnify and hold MIC, its directors, officers, employees, and agents (each, an 
"Indemnified Party") harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, demands and expenses incurred by an 
Indemnified Party (including reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses of investigation and litigation, including all appeals) 
based upon, related to, or arising from our relationship with Customer, including but not limited to claims asserting a 
communications failure, improper use of information, or program error.</p>
<p><span class="mark">3.7</span> THE MIC SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." THE PARTIES DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. MIC SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR, AND CUSTOMER WAIVES AND RELEASES ANY CLAIMS FOR, CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, OR ANY AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THESE LIMITATIONS 
APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF 
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.</p>

<span class="mark">4. Usage Terms:</span>
<p><span class="mark">4.1</span> Customer understands and agrees that only active customers of SMX are eligible to participate in 
the WebNet Program. For the purpose of this Paragraph, an "active customer" is defined as a customer who has purchased SMX-branded 
product from a SMX distribution center or from one of SMX's independent distributors within the 90 day period immediately preceding 
the date on which the Customer requests services from MIC. Notwithstanding the terms of this Agreement, since SMX retains compete 
control over the WebNet Program and the use of its intellectual property, SMX reserves the unilateral right to prohibit any Customer 
from participating in the WebNet Program, as described in this Agreement, even if the Customer qualifies as an "active customer."</p>
<p><span class="mark">4.2</span> The Customer agrees to utilize the WebNet site to promote its business only as a re-seller of SMX 
products. Customer agrees that it will not use the WebNet site to promote other products and services offered by the customer. 
Customer will not post or display any logos or other representations of competitive products on the WebNet site. Further, Customer 
will not post or display any inappropriate material on the WebNet site including, but not limited to vulgar, obscene, or offensive 
images or language.</p>
<p><span class="mark">4.3</span> SMX has and retains the unilateral right to cancel the Customer's WebNet access and customized 
WebNet site at any time and for any reason whatsoever, including, but not limited to: lack of payment, active customer status 
changing to inactive, improper use of the site including the promotion of non-SMX products and services, and complaints of poor 
customer service or poor business practices.</p>
<p><span class="mark">4.4</span> WebNet payments made by the Customer are non-refundable if the account is cancelled either by the 
Customer or by SMX.</p>
