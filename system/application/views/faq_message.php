<h1 class="orange" style="margin-bottom:0px;">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h4 onclick="toggle_visibility('a1');" class="textbutton" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'">What are SUN-GARD window films?</h4>
<p id ="a1" class="hidden">SUN-GARD window films are a family of products that are applied to glass either for automotive or architectural purposes. Made from the highest grade polyester, our films are treated with various coating and laminating techniques to produce the desired color and performance characteristics. With a wide range to choose from, you are sure to find the perfect film to help control the sun's heat, UV rays and glare in your vehicle, home or office.</p>

<h4 onclick="toggle_visibility('a2');" class="textbutton" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'">How do SUN-GARD window films work?</h4>
<p id ="a2" class="hidden">By increasing the amount of solar heat that is reflected or absorbed by the film, SUN-GARD products reduce the amount of heat that is transmitted through the glass. Reducing solar heat offers a more comfortable interior space in a building or vehicle. Utilizing various processes in the construction of our films, allows us to provide a varying degree to which our films reduce solar heat transmission. Some films contain a layer of metal that provides a high amount of solar heat reflection (even though the film itself is not necessarily reflective). Other films contain no metal but still offer a level of heat rejection that will provide significant benefits. Please consult your SUN-GARD professional retailer to find out which film is best for you.</p>

<h4 onclick="toggle_visibility('a3');" class="textbutton" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'">How is SUN-GARD window film applied?</h4>
<p id ="a3" class="hidden">SUN-GARD window film is professionally installed by a well-trained SUN-GARD dealer. Most of our films are designed to be installed on the inside of your windows or glass doors. 
<br /><br />
For architectural applications: The first step is preparation which includes thoroughly cleaning the windows and the immediate surrounding work space&mdash;this could require moving furniture, removing window treatments and protecting the flooring below. Then the film is sprayed with a mounting solution to allow it to be properly positioned on the glass. Using professional tools and techniques, the installing dealer will form the film to the glass surface being sure to remove any excess water. They will then trim the edges of the film for a perfect fit and complete the process with a final squeegee technique to ensure the film is in place.
<br /><br />
For automotive applications: The glass is first thoroughly cleaned. The installing dealer will then wet the film and apply it to the outside of the window. Using a heat gun, they will form the film to the exact curvature of the window. After this, the film is carefully removed from the outside of the window and applied with a squeegee to the inside of the glass. The installing dealer will trim any excess film and will complete the installation by making sure the film is firmly in place.</p>

<h4 onclick="toggle_visibility('b1');" class="textbutton" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'">How long does it take for SUN-GARD window film to dry?</h4>
<p id ="b1" class="hidden">Depending on weather conditions and the film type, it can take up to 30 sometimes even 45 days for the film to fully dry and cure. During this time, you may notice small water bubbles and/or a hazy appearance. This is normal and will disappear as the film dries. Once completely dry, your SUN-GARD window film will be virtually undetectable and will look great for years to come.</p>

<h4 onclick="toggle_visibility('b2');" class="textbutton" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'">How long will SUN-GARD window film last?</h4>
<p id ="b2" class="hidden">Made with only the highest grade raw materials, SUN-GARD window films are made to last for many years. The exact life of the film depends on the film type, the climate and the type of glass in which it is installed. Most automotive applications last in upwards of 10 years. Architectural films can easily last 10 to 15 years, sometimes longer. The important thing to remember is that all of our films are backed by a manufacturer's warranty. Speak with your SUN-GARD dealer for warranty details as some restrictions may apply.</p>

<h4 onclick="toggle_visibility('b3');" class="textbutton" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'">Will SUN-GARD film kill my house plants?</h4>
<p id ="b3" class="hidden">No, SUN-GARD window film will not harm your house plants or anything else on the interior of your home. As a matter of fact, SUN-GARD film will help protect your flooring and furnishings from fading caused by exposure to UV rays and solar heat.
</p>

<h4 onclick="toggle_visibility('b4');" class="textbutton" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'">Will SUN-GARD window film cause glass to break?</h4>
<p id ="b4" class="hidden">While adding solar control film to glass will increase the glass temperature, properly chosen film will not cause glass to break. There are a number of factors that can contribute to the rare case of glass breakage. These include the amount of external shading, interior shading, glass size and shape, age of the glass, previous glass breakage history, certain film types on certain types of glass, interior versus exterior temperatures, and more. With more than 35 years of experience, we are able to make proper film-to-glass recommendations thus minimizing the risk of glass breakage. We also offer limited warranty protection against glass breakage and seal failure for properly applied installations. Consult your SUN-GARD dealer for details and to obtain a copy of our architectural film warranty.</p>

<h4 onclick="toggle_visibility('b5');" class="textbutton" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'">How much UV protection will SUN-GARD film provide?</h4>
<p id ="b5" class="hidden">All SUN-GARD automotive and architectural window films can block up to 99% of harmful ultraviolet rays. This can help protect against skin-related issues including skin cancer. UV rays also contribute to fading of interior furnishings and flooring. SUN-GARD helps reduce fading by not only blocking UV rays but also blocking up to 80% of harmful solar heat.</p>

<h4 onclick="toggle_visibility('b6');" class="textbutton" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'">What energy savings can I expect from installing solar control film?</h4>
<p id ="b6" class="hidden">Installing SUN-GARD solar control film reduces the amount of solar heat entering your home or property which can result in lower cooling costs in the summer. However, determining exact energy savings can be difficult because many factors contribute to energy use such as the fluctuating cost of fuel, amount of direct sun exposure, type of film installed, type of glass, and many others. However, typical payback in energy savings is usually 2-5 years, sometimes less. Speak with your local SUN-GARD dealer regarding your particular situation; they can help you analyze and determine potential savings.</p>
