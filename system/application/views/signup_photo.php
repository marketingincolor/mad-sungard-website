<h2 class="orange">Displaying A Photo</h2>

<p>This form gives you the opportunity to display a photo on your WebNet Site. We recommend that you upload a photo of an individual, 
a company logo, or an image representative of your business, such as a building photo. To upload, simply locate and click the "browse" 
button in the form, locate the photo file you wish to upload, and double-click it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">If you're not ready to provide a photo at this time, avoid delaying the launch of your WebNet site by completing the rest of the form anyway.</span> 
You'll have another opportunity to upload a photo later.</p>

<h2 class="orange">About Your Photo</h2>
<img src="<?php echo base_url();?>images/sgd_helpphoto.jpg" border="0" class="right" style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>Your WebNet Site comes with a placeholder image
you are welcome to leave as is or to replace with
an image of your own. For best results, size and crop
your image yourself to the following specs:
<br><br>
<span class="bold">
<ul><li>230 pixels wide by 170 pixels high</li>
<li>Saved as JPG or GIF format only</li></ul></span>
<br><br>
If you need a photo editor, try an online resource
such as <a href="http://www.picnik.com" target="_blanknew">Picnik.</a>
<br><br>
<a href="#details">If you upload without resizing</a>, the system will
automatically resize your image so that it's no larger
than 230 pixels wide or 170 pixels high, whichever
is greater. Please upload JPG or GIF format only.</p>
