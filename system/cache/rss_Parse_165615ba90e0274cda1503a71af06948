<title>Join Madico in Recognizing Skin Cancer Awareness Month</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.sungarddealer.com/2015/05/join-madico-in-recognizing-skin-cancer-awareness-month.html</guid>
<description>May is Skin Cancer Awareness Month and we invite you to join Madico Window Films in spreading the word about the importance of protecting yourself and your family from the sun’s harmful UV rays. Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States. One in five...</description>


<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/MadicoWindowFilms&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;11201855_10153084260867740_2668554027989028197_n&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30b6954970b01b7c78da5d6970b image-full img-responsive&quot; height=&quot;596&quot; src=&quot;http://sun-gard.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30b6954970b01b7c78da5d6970b-800wi&quot; style=&quot;width: 40.12%; height: 221px; float: right;&quot; title=&quot;11201855_10153084260867740_2668554027989028197_n&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May is Skin Cancer Awareness Month and we invite you to join Madico Window Films in spreading the word about the importance of protecting yourself and your family from the sun’s harmful UV rays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/skin-cancer-facts#general&quot;&gt;One in five Americans will develop skin cancer in the course of a lifetime.&lt;/a&gt; Overexposure to the sun’s harmful UV rays can lead to the most dangerous form of skin cancer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/melanoma?utm_source=Madico+WebNet+Users&amp;amp;utm_campaign=eadf8264db-News_From_Madico_Sunscape_Issue_505_15_2015&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_3b6ae8fd99-eadf8264db-422467897&quot;&gt;Melanoma, which causes nearly 10,000 deaths each year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s understood that taking sun safety precautions while outside is important, such as applying sunscreen and wearing a hat, many people don’t realize the potential damage UV rays can also cause to the skin while indoors. Window film can offer significant skin protection by blocking as much as 99% of the sun’s harmful UV rays that shine in through your car, home or office windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that nearly 53% of skin cancers occur on the left, or drivers’ side, of the body? Tinting your car’s windows will offer you the protection you need to lower your risk of skin cancer as well as create a more comfortable driving experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Window film provides you and your family or employees&amp;#0160;passive protection while relaxing at home, driving in the car or focusing at work. Additional benefits include a more comfortable&amp;#0160;environment free from glare and hot spots as well as minimilzie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information and tips&amp;#0160;on preventing skin cancer, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skincancer.org/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;The Skin Cancer Foundation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;We are proud to share that the Mayor of St. Petersburg, Rick Kriseman, has also proclaimed April 30, 2015 Window Film Day in Madico Window Fim&amp;#39;s hometown of St. Petersburg in recognition of the citizens who manufacture, distribute and install window film as well as the industry association (IWFA) that educates the public about the many benefits of window film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are honored to have the Mayor issue this proclamation in the City of St. Petersburg; home of the Southeast’s only window film manufacturer, Madico Window Films, for over 4 decades and employing over 100 local residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.windowfilmmag.com/2015/04/locales-make-public-proclamations-for-window-film/&quot;&gt;Window Film Magazine &lt;/a&gt;recently covered the proclamation in St. Petersburg as well as the proclamation by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia. We are excited to see these proclamations spreading across the United States!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In celebration of National Window Film Day, we are also offering industry professionals a free, commemorative poster.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Window film technology has improved since it was first conceived. Newer films are high-tech products that adhere well and greatly improve an old window&amp;#39;s performance at a modest cost. As this advocate for films suggests, they definitely should have a place at the green retrofit table. -Green Builder Magazine Editor - &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The window film industry is happy to share that &lt;a href=&quot;http://sun-gard.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30b6954970b01bb07e1263d970d-pi&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Shutterstock_utility-bill-300x200&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://sun-gard.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30b6954970b01bb07e1263d970d-800wi&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot; title=&quot;Shutterstock_utility-bill-300x200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Congress has extended tax credits for residential window film purchased in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To receive the tax credit, homeowners are required to submit IRS Form 5695 with their 2014 Income Tax Return. Retain your original film invoice illustrating the cost of the window film only and a copy of the product’s certification from Madico. They do not need to be submitted with your taxes, but should be kept for your records. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.madico.com/window-film/architectural-2/architectural/federal-tax-credit/&quot;&gt;You can download Madico’s Manufacturer’s Certification here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers should use the 2014 version IRS Form 5695 when submitting their taxes. The window film credits fall under “insulation” in the Federal Tax Credits for Energy Efficiency program. For more information visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.energystar.gov/about/federal_tax_credits&quot;&gt;Energy Star web page for Federal Tax Credits for Energy Efficiency.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is the press release on this subject issued by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iwfa.com/&quot;&gt;IWFA&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The International Window Film Association Educates Consumers On How To Take Advantage of the $500 Tax Credit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Washington, D.C. – January 6, 2015&amp;#0160; – Window Film is eligible for tax credits recently extended by Congress and the tax incentive can cover up to 10 percent of the cost of window films to a maximum of $500, reports the International Window Film Association (IWFA). The one-year retroactive tax credit may allow taxpayers to claim the incentives on their 2014 returns filed in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;“We are delighted that Congress recently passed HR 5771 that includes tax incentives for energy efficient home improvements, such as window film,” said Darrell Smith, executive director of the nonprofit IWFA. To make people more aware about the many benefits of window films the IWFA offers informational videos available at www.iwfa.com and free consumer booklets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;As a long-term and cost-effective solution for saving energy, window film qualifies in the legislation as part of a building’s ‘insulation envelope’. It can reduce energy consumption from solar heat gain in summer or reflect interior heat back inside in winter, while allowing in natural light without the negative impact of UV exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Year-round, window film can help to control glass breakage and may prevent glass shards from hurting people. Consumers should check with their window film installer or manufacturer to determine if their product qualifies under the tax incentive program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;While reducing our energy use and an energy user’s overall carbon footprint, some energy-efficient changes require significant investment, but window film has been shown to be a cost-effective means of improving energy performance. Window Film is also part of the California building code, in part due to its recognition for offering a high-value, low-cost method for saving energy. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
