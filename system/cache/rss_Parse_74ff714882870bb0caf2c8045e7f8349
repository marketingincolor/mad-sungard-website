<img alt="Caught-in-the-dark" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30b6954970b0133f39e291a970b " src="http://sun-gard.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30b6954970b0133f39e291a970b-800wi" title="Caught-in-the-dark" /> </p><p><br /> Tinting your car windows has a variety of benefits including 
blocking the sun’s dreadful heat and damaging ultraviolet rays, 
protecting the interior of the vehicle, and holding shattered glass in 
place.  While you’re also protecting your eyes, skin and precious 
cargo, we strongly advise that your window tint is installed safely and 
legally.</p>
<p>Before selecting the right window film for your vehicle, make sure you and your dealer are well-versed in the <a href="http://solamatrix.com/documents/State%20Law%20Chart%2012-30-09.pdf" target="_blank">tinting laws of your state</a>.
 Every state has its own laws and local police departments regulate the 
laws differently. Fines can range from $50 to $500 if your tint is too 
dark or if you’re not in compliance. We also advise our reputable <span class="caps">SUN</span>-<span class="caps">GARD</span> dealers to stay on top of state laws before applying window tint to any customer’s vehicle.</p>
<p>Also, if your window film was installed in one state and you move to 
another state (or are traveling within), their laws may be different and
 you may be out of compliance. Again, we advise to check the tinting 
laws of each state before you are ticketed!</p>
<p>Some of the regulations included in tinting laws range from which 
windows are allowed to be tinted, darkness of the tint, reflection, type
 of vehicle and type of film. Many states may make exceptions based on 
medical conditions which require heavy protection from the sun.</p>
<p>Darkness of tint is measured by Visible Light Transmission percentage (<span class="caps">VLT</span>%).
 This percentage refers to percentage of visible light allowed in 
through the combination of film and the window. Reflection percentages 
are also regulated. Similar to sunglass lenses, some tinted film 
contains metallic elements that help reflect incoming light and reduce 
glare and heat generated by visible light. Also, most states laws view 
each set of windows separately and the back side windows can have a 
darker tint than the front side windows.</p>
<p>Window tinting is regulated for the safety of pedestrians, other 
drivers and oftentimes, police officers. With darker windows comes lower
 visibility and at night, this is a safety concern. Once you have 
reviewed the <a href="http://solamatrix.com/documents/State%20Law%20Chart%2012-30-09.pdf" target="_blank">laws in your area</a>, you can best determine which shade to use for your vehicle.</p>
<p>For the most up-to-date rules and regulations for your state, check with your dealer or state traffic laws.</p>

Recognizing the importance in improving heating and cooling where we live, a provision in last year’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 (ARRA) included a tax credit opportunity for window films installed in residential structures from 2009 through 2010. And it just so happens, SUN-GARD® and GLASS-GARD® are <a href="http://solamatrix.com/documents/SMX_manuf_cert_doc&amp;207_09.pdf" target="_blank">certified manufacturers</a> of solar control window films eligible for the tax credit!<br /><br />If you haven’t done so already, there are only a few months left to take advantage of the savings for 2010. Here are the details:<br /><ul>
<li>Under the policy, qualifying improvements made January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010, can receive a tax credit equal to 30% of the solar control film purchase price (not including installation costs) and up to a maximum total credit of $1500 for qualifying film installations.</li>
<li>SUN-GARD solar control window films are eligible if used as an insulation material or system designed to reduce heat loss or heat gain in a home.</li>
<li>Energy-saving requirements become more stringent in the central and northern parts of the country which also limits the number of qualifying films. In order to determine which films qualify in your area, please refer to the <a href="http://http//solamatrix.com/documents/SMX_manuf_cert_doc&amp;207_09.pdf" target="_blank">Solamatrix Manufacturer’s Certificate.</a></li>
<li>Just fill out IRS form 5695 and submit with your 2010 Income Tax Return by April 15, 2011. Forms are downloadable at <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=tax_credits.tx_index" target="_blank">www.energystar.gov</a> along with a list of other available energy efficiency tax credits.</li>
<li>You must maintain copies of the dealer invoice and manufacturer’s <a href="http://solamatrix.com/documents/SMX_manuf_cert_doc&amp;207_09.pdf" target="_blank">certification statement</a> for your records.</li>
</ul>
Beyond the benefits of a tax credit, installing protective window film in your home will help reduce your energy bill. Heat gained through windows makes up to 40 percent of utility usage. Solar control window film reduces heat gain by 80 percent, which helps lower energy consumption, subsequently reducing your monthly energy bill, saving you more money!<br /><br />SUN-GARD excels as a manufacturer of quality solar control window film, but we are not tax advisors. Please consult your tax advisor regarding your eligibility with respect to any tax credit.<br /><br />Additional Resources:<br /><br /><a href="http://solamatrix.com/documents/SMX_manuf_cert_doc&amp;207_09.pdf" target="_blank">Solamatrix Manufacturer’s Certificate</a><br /><br /><a href="http://solamatrix.com/documents/SMX_dealer_tax%20credit_faq.pdf" target="_blank">2009/2010 Tax Credit for Window Film FAQ</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5695.pdf" target="_blank">IRS Form 5695</a><br /><p><a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=tax_credits.tx_index" target="_blank">Energy Star</a></p><p>Find a SUN-GARD dealer near you today!

 <p>Every company believes in the value of building relationships

 dealers and request their installation services via the web. Customized
 dealer websites also allow satisfied consumers to refer the Sun-Gard 
dealers to friends via Facebook, Twitter, and an online referral form.

and services) that we strive for a competitive edge. Through this blog 
we will share resources, accomplishments and also highlight distributors
 who have a success story or unique customer experience.</p>
<p>A blog about window film, you say? Absolutely! But, it’s not just 
about window film…it’s about protection, comfort, appearance, durability
 and environmental consciousness. It’s about offering the best of the 
best in window protection, about building strong relationships and 
providing exceptional customer service. That’s what <span class="caps">SUN</span>-<span class="caps">GARD</span> is about.</p>
<p>Our mission is to offer not only innovative products, but also 
innovative solutions, tailored to specific needs. While we excel in 
window film, we also strive to create heightened awareness about our 
leading-edge products. The world is changing and so are we.</p>

wanting to be more energy efficient. And that residential tint is on the
 rise.
